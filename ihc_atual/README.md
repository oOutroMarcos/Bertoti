Using the article 10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design as a base, here are a couple of examples of bad and good uses of heuristics.

# HEURISTICS EXAMPLES

## EXAMPLE 1: "1.Keep Status visible"
In general, the human being is first assimilated visually. When we are in a physical environment we have other senses that inform us what is happening, but when we talk about a system, software or interface this story changes a little. In digital environments the need for clarity in the visual context is even greater and you need to inform your user about what is going on, say how it is going, where it is going or what comes next.

When we are watching a playlist on Youtube, we have on the right side an indicator of which video we are watching, which are the previous videos and which are the next. This makes context analysis easy for the user.

## EXAMPLE 2: "8.Minimalist Design and Aesthetics"
Transmitting only essential information will decrease the amount of information that will be analyzed and decisions that the user will need to make. The screens need to be simple, avoiding unnecessary information and the chances of the user not being able to meet their goals.
Seek to generate simple layouts that guide the user in his choices and offering clear options for the user to reach his goals.

In the microsoft edge home page we see a bad example of 8 heuristic "Minimalist Design and Aesthetics". The page is almost completely full of information that we normaly not use.

## EXAMPLE 3: "3.Exert control without taking away freedom"
Often the user performs actions by mistake, give him the “Ctrl Z” on his system !!
The system should present the user with an “emergency exit” from that state he entered (by mistake) to the security state he was in. This possibility of reversing actions removes the insecurity of the user when using the application, website, etc.
It is important that you direct the user to help him accomplish his task, without taking away his options of using his system freely, as long as there are no problems with business rules and system functionality, of course!

In youtube playlist(again) for example, when you remove a video from you playlist it will appear a pop up with the option to cancel you action.
